we will be creating a web app and host it on firebase free tier that will be used by developer.students or any other person wrking on any project with the
wish of working on projects.the appp features will include:

1.graphical tracking for projects 

when the user adds a project on the dashboard the app the user projects by allowing for journals and logging which will be used as raw data for 
graph creation for the projects.

2. add projects

users will be pressented with a "add project" button on the dashboard where our users will be able to add multiple projects. free tiers will be for
a max of 5 projects beyond that, the user will be required  to upgrade their subscription

3.free tiers 

the free tiers on the app allow for a max of 5 projects per user for more project user will be required to subscribe.

4.countdown
 
after user creates a proect the user will be prompted to input project period and name .immediately the user presses start the countdown begins.

5.motivations and compliments 

after the time period is done the user fails to keep logs then the graph will not be generated. the user recieves encouragements when this happens.
whereas when the user keeps inputing and journaling or keeping logs and a good graph works out for the user. the user will recieve badges and one 
free project space for 6 months . meaning this will encourage user interaction and improve the number of users 

the appp will be created and hosted on firebase free tier
